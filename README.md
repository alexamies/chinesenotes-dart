# chinesenotes
Chinese-English dictionary and text processing tools in Dart

This is experimental. There is nothing much here yet.

## Using in a web app
A sample web app is provided in the `web` directory. It uses a sample dictionary
to avoid CORS problems when getting started. To start the web app type

```shell
webdev serve
```

There are only two entries in the sample dictionary: 四面八方 and 四周.
